Setup
-----

1) Place the litle-sdk-for-java.jar in your classpath 

2) Once the sdk is installed run our setup program to generate a configuration file.  The configuration file resides in your home directory
$HOME/.litle_SDK_config.properties

3.) Create a java class similar to:  

```java
import com.litle.sdk.*;
import com.litle.sdk.generated.*

public class SampleLitleTxn {

	public static void main(String[] args) {

		// Visa $10 Sale
		Sale sale = new Sale();
		sale.setReportGroup("Planets");
		sale.setOrderId("12344");
		sale.setAmount(1000L);
		sale.setOrderSource(OrderSourceType.ECOMMERCE);
		CardType card = new CardType();
		card.setType(MethodOfPaymentTypeEnum.VI);
		card.setNumber("4100000000000002");
		card.setExpDate("1210");
		sale.setCard(card);
		
		// Peform the transaction on the Litle Platform
		SaleResponse response = new LitleOnline().sale(sale);

		// display result
		System.out.println("Message: " + response.getMessage());
		System.out.println("Litle Transaction ID: " + response.getLitleTxnId());
	}
}
```

4) Compile and run this file.  You should see the following result provided you have connectivity to the Litle certification environment.  You will see an HTTP error if you don't have access to the Litle URL
